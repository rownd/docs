Rownd's Unverified Users feature allows new users to sign in with their email or phone number without immediately needing to verify. Existing users, or sign-in attempts with an email or phone number for which a user already exists will be required to verify immediately.

With Unverified Users you can reduce friction in your onboarding experience and dramatically improve conversion rates. Drive customers deeper into your onboarding funnel and give them incentive to stay before forcing them to verify.
