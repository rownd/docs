# Global style

### Elements you can customize

* **Primary color**. Rownd default primary color is Purple #5B13DF. You can change this color to match your brand color.
* **Corner radiuses.** By default, Rownd modal and hub corners have rounded edges; you can choose between rounded and square corners on UI elements.
* **Overlay blurring**. By default, overlays (behind modals) blur the background. You can leave this on or turn it off.
* **Visual elements.** Most Rownd dialogs include "visual swoops" at the bottom that match the primary color you select. You can choose to remove these for your application.

### **How to customize**

1. In the Rownd dashboard, navigate to the "Rownd Hub" tab in the left navigation.
2. Select the "Style and content" tab on this page.
3. Edit and change the primary color, corners, background blur, and visual elements with the options on the left side of the screen.
4. Preview your changes in an example UI dialog on the right side of the screen.
5. Press **Save** before leaving the page. Your updates will be applied to the websites and apps where you've installed the Rownd code snippet.
