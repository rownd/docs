## What is SOC 2 Type 2 certification?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is a rigorous auditing standard developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). It focuses on five key trust service principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC 2 Type 2 certification specifically evaluates the operational effectiveness of these controls over a period of time, typically six months or more.
