Bot detection helps protect against scripted attacks by identifying requests that are likely coming from bots. This method of protection is effective against certain types of attacks while minimizing inconvenience to legitimate users.  

Rownd uses an invisible, rotating challenge to bring top-of-the-line bot detection to your app and website. Bots or human actors that fail the challenge are denied entry, so new users are not created. This protection focuses on sign-ins using email or SMS, since these are the most vulnerable to attack from bots.

Sign-in with Google and Sign-in with Apple both have their own bot detection and security that adds additional layers of protection.

### Enabling bot protection
It's enabled for all Rownd applications.
