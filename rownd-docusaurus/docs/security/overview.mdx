When it comes to authentication, security is paramount. Rownd takes the security of your data seriously. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest. We limit access to production environments to only those who need it in order to operate the service. We also provide controls to make it easier for you to secure your apps and websites against fraud and unauthorized access.

Here are a few of the ways Rownd secures our platform and your products.
