  "Rownd applications connect to your product(s) to provide Rownd authentication
  to your users."
---

A Rownd application contains a unique code snippet that, when injected across
your product, provides user authentication to your platform. Within your Rownd
application, you can define and customize authentication methods, data types,
and more. You can also connect a Rownd application to your existing tools with
Integrations. It is likely that one Rownd application is enough to span all
aspects of your product, but you can create multiple Rownd apps in your account
as needed. However, a user session cannot span multiple applications.

<Info>
Your application name is used in all verification messages used to authenticate
your users. We recommend using the name of your company or product for your
application name.

### Edit an application

Rownd creates a sample application during initial account setup. You can edit it to suit your needs.

Modify the name, description, and logo of your existing application from
the **Settings** tab.

1. On the Settings tab, set the  **Application name** and **Application description** as desired.

2. Drag and drop a logo (PNG or SVG) into the **Application logo** area, or click within it to display a file picker.

3. Press **Save edits** when finished.

#### Create a new application

You may want to create additional applications for separate products or for dev/test environments.

To create a new application:

1. Click the application dropdown in the top left corner, and select **Create new
   application** from the list.

2. In the next screen, enter an application name. Optionally, provide a description and logo.

3. Press **Create**.

4. Your newly created app will open to its Home tab.


#### Switch to another application

If you have multiple Rownd applications, you can switch between them using the application switcher.

1. Press the application switcher in the top left corner of the sidebar.

2. Select a different application from the list of applications.


Not seeing the application you're looking for?

- Try selecting **switch account** in the top right dropdown menu to see if the
  application you are looking for is associated with a different account.

- Are you signed in with the correct user identifier (e.g., email address)? It's possible that the application
  you are looking for is associated with an account your current user doesn't have access to. Try signing out and
  signing back in with a different email address or social provider.

#### Delete an application

If you wish to delete an application, you can delete it from the **Settings** tab.

1. From the Settings tab, scroll to the bottom and press **Delete application**.

2. In the modal that appears, confirm you want to delete the app by pressing **Delete**.

<Warning>
Deleting your Rownd application completely removes all application data from
Rownd. If the application is being used to authenticate users in your product,
deleting it will prevent any further registrations or authentications.
