## Anatomy of a Rownd User Profile

A Rownd user profile is a comprehensive collection of user data, attributes, and metadata that allows you to manage and understand your users effectively. This document provides an overview of the key components of a Rownd user profile.

### User data

User data includes fields matching your app's profile data schema. This typically includes fields like:

- **User ID**: A unique identifier for the user.
- **Email**: The user's email address.
- **Phone Number**: The user's phone number.
- **Name**: The user's full name.

Rownd facilitates a strongly-defined user profile schema to ensure consistency and compatibility across your app. You can add as many custom fields as needed to capture additional user information. Each field specifies a data type, such as string, number, boolean, array, object, document, image, and so on.

By default, a user can update any of their profile data (other than their user ID) through Rownd's provided UI components or APIs. You can change a field's visibility or editability settings to restrict user access to specific data.

<Note type="tip">
Rownd profiles can store file objects like images and documnets so that you don't need additional systems for user avatars and other small artifacts.

### Attributes

Attributes are custom data points that you can define and attach to a user profile. These are technically visible to the user, but they are only editable with your application credentials. Rownd's pre-built UI components won't display this data to the user, but savvy users could still view by looking at API responses in their browser (for example).

Attribute names follow the format `namespace:key` and store an array of string values like `["value1", "value2"]`.

You can store any attribute you want; however, note the following namespaces are reserved by Rownd, so you won't be able to create custom attributes in these namespaces. See the section on pre-defined attributes below for a list of writable reserved attributes.
- `rownd:`
- `system:`

#### Pre-defined attributes
The following table lists all of the pre-defined attributes that Rownd uses. You can modify these attributes through Rownd's REST API or through the Rownd Platform. Invalid values within these attributes are typically ignored.

| Attribute Name | Description | Example value |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `rownd:app_variants` | A list of sub-brands the user has interacted with. | `["id1234", "id5678"]` |

#### Custom Attributes
You might decide to include your own custom attributes within a user's profile. Here are some common use cases:

- **Custom fields**: Any additional information you want to store about the user, such as preferences, subscription status, or loyalty points.
- **Tags**: Labels that help categorize and segment users for targeted actions or communications.

Examples:
```json
{
    "attributes": {
        "myapp:loyalty_points": ["100"],
        "myapp:tags": ["premium", "vip"]
    }
}
```

### Metadata

Metadata provides additional context about the user's interactions and status within your application. This includes:

- **Sign-in Methods**: Information about how the user signed in (e.g., email, social login).
- **Last Sign-in Time**: The last time the user signed into your application.
- **Sub-brands**: A map of sub-brands the user has interacted with, including the sign-in method used and the last sign-in time for each sub-brand.

Most metadata is read-only and is managed by Rownd on your behalf. You can access this information through the Rownd API or the Rownd Platform.

### Example user profile structure

Here is an example structure of a Rownd user profile. The `data` attribute will differ based on your app's profile schema.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "user_id": "user_a3vc29gjsaf0h",
        "email": "juliet@example.com",

### Managing User Profiles

To manage user profiles, you can use the Rownd platform's user management features. This includes viewing and editing user profiles, managing sub-brands, and viewing user activity and metadata.

For more detailed information on managing user profiles, refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/user-profiles/app/insert-update).

By understanding the anatomy of a Rownd user profile, you can better manage your users and provide a personalized experience across your applications.
