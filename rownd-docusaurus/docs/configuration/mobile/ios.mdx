Configure Rownd for iOS mobile devices including ([React Native](/sdk-reference/mobile/react-native) and [Flutter](/sdk-reference/mobile/flutter)). This configuration will allow multiple Rownd services to work in the iOS operating system like [Universal Links](/configuration/mobile/overview#what-are-universal-links) and [Passkeys](/configuration/authentication-methods/passkeys).

### 1. Configure in Rownd Platform

1. Select **Sign-in methods** from the left navigation menu.
2. In the Sign-in preferences section, locate [**Mobile app settings**](/configuration/mobile/mobile-app-settings)
3. Fill out mobile app settings for iOS
   - Subdomain (e.g., myapp for myapp.rownd.link - the .rownd.link portion is added automatically).
   - App store URL - The direct link to your app in the Apple App Store
   - Bundle IDs - A comma-separated list of bundle IDs for your app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`)
   - Team ID - The team ID for your app as shown in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account) (e.g., `15GKOXA3H6`)
4. Ensure iOS is **enabled** and hit **save**
