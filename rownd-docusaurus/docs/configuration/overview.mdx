  "The Rownd platform gives everything you need to add customizable
  authentication to your product"
---

Rownd provides an out-of-the-box configuration allowing you to deploy frictionless authentication into your product in minutes. However, we know that your users have unique expectations that affect how they think about authentication. Some are technically-minded and will consciously pick a specific sign-in method while others will simply press the default or select whatever seems simplest.

Rownd makes it easy to adjust your sign-in experience for what best fits your user-base. Rownd also dynamically tweaks the sign-in flow per user based on the their device, browser, and behaviors.

You can adjust your product's sign-in experience in the following ways:
