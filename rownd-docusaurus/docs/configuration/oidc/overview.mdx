**4. Set your OIDC client details** 



![OIDC Clients](details-oidc.png)


#### Fields
- **Name**: A display name for your OIDC client (required)
- **Redirect URIs**: Where users will be redirected after authentication (required). You can add more than one.
  - Example: `https://example.com/callback`  
- **Allowed Scopes**: The scopes that the OIDC client is allowed to request. You can add more than one.
  - Example: `openid profile email` ; note; you can add additional date fields to Rownd for more finite scopes.

Click "Next"

**5. Retrieve client credentials and OpenID endpoints** 
You can now retrieve your client credentials and use them to configure your OIDC client.  You can also see the OIDC endpoints.  

<Note>
Make sure to save your client credentials (client_id and secret) after creation, as the secret cannot be retrieved later.
</Note>

## OpenID Configuration Discovery

Rownd provides a standard OpenID Configuration discovery endpoint that returns a complete list of OIDC specifications and endpoints for your application.

### Discovery Endpoint

```http
GET api.rownd.io/oidc/{app_id}/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Replace `{app_id}` with your Rownd application ID to get the complete OIDC configuration for your app. For example:
```
https://api.rownd.io/oidc/app_wj43asd4ywn790plclbhux6a/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

This endpoint returns a JSON document containing all supported OIDC features, endpoints, and capabilities of your Rownd OIDC server, following the OpenID Connect Discovery specification.

<Note>
The discovery endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require authentication. It's commonly used by OIDC clients to automatically configure themselves.
</Note>

## OpenID Endpoints

Rownd provides three main OIDC endpoints, all accessible at `https://api.rownd.io/oidc/{app-id}/`:

### 1. Authorization Endpoint (`/auth`)
- Used to authenticate users and obtain authorization
- Initiates the authentication flow
- Returns an authorization code that can be exchanged for tokens
- Supports standard OIDC parameters like `scope`, `response_type`, and `redirect_uri`

### 2. Token Endpoint (`/token`)
- Exchanges authorization codes for access and ID tokens
- Supports refresh token requests
- Requires client authentication using client_id and client_secret
- Returns JWT tokens containing user information and access rights

### 3. UserInfo Endpoint (`/me`)
- Provides detailed information about the authenticated user
- Requires a valid access token
- Returns user profile data based on the granted scopes
- Supports standard OIDC claims

## Credentials

After creating an OIDC client configuration, you'll receive credentials in the response:

- `client_id`: Your unique client identifier
- `client_secret`: Your client secret for secure communication

<Warning>
Store your client_secret securely! It cannot be recovered if lost and would require generating new credentials.
</Warning>

## Implementation Flow

1. Configure your OpenID client using the configuration endpoint
2. Store the returned client_id and client_secret securely
3. Implement the authorization flow:
   - Direct users to the `/auth` endpoint for authentication
   - Handle the callback with the authorization code
   - Exchange the code for tokens at the `/token` endpoint
   - Fetch user information from the `/me` endpoint as needed

## Example Implementation

```javascript
// Example authorization request
const authUrl = `https://api.rownd.io/oidc/${appId}/auth?` + 
  `client_id=${clientId}&` +
  `redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUri)}&` +
  `response_type=code&` +
  `scope=openid profile email`;

// Redirect user to authUrl

// After receiving the authorization code in your callback:
async function exchangeCode(code) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.rownd.io/oidc/${appId}/token`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type: 'authorization_code',
      code,
      client_id: clientId,
      client_secret: clientSecret,
      redirect_uri: redirectUri,
    }),
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use HTTPS for redirect URIs
2. Implement proper token storage and refresh mechanisms
3. Validate all tokens on your backend
4. Keep your client_secret secure and never expose it in client-side code
5. Implement proper error handling for all OIDC endpoints

### Uploading OpenID Client Logos

You can upload custom logos for your OIDC client that will be displayed in light and dark modes. Logos can be uploaded using the following API endpoint.

#### Logo Upload Endpoint

```http
PUT /application/{app-id}/oidc_clients/{client-id}/logo/{type}
```

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `app` | Your Rownd application ID |
| `client` | Your OIDC client ID |
| `type` | Either 'light' or 'dark' for the respective display modes |

#### Required Headers
| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `x-rownd-app-key` | Your Rownd application key |
| `x-rownd-app-secret` | Your Rownd application secret |
| `x-rownd-filename` | The filename of your logo |

<Note>
Only PNG and SVG file formats are supported for logo uploads.
</Note>

#### cURL Example

```bash
# Upload light mode logo
curl -X PUT 'https://api.rownd.io/application/{app-id}/oidc_clients/{client-id}/logo/light' \
-H 'x-rownd-app-key: YOUR_APP_KEY' \
-H 'x-rownd-app-secret: YOUR_APP_SECRET' \
-H 'x-rownd-filename: logo.png' \
-H 'Content-Type: image/png' \
--data-binary '@/path/to/your/logo.png'

# Upload dark mode logo
curl -X PUT 'https://api.rownd.io/application/{app-id}/oidc_clients/{client-id}/logo/dark' \
-H 'x-rownd-app-key: YOUR_APP_KEY' \
-H 'x-rownd-app-secret: YOUR_APP_SECRET' \
-H 'x-rownd-filename: logo-dark.svg' \
-H 'Content-Type: image/svg+xml' \
--data-binary '@/path/to/your/logo-dark.svg'
```

<Warning>
Ensure your logo files meet the following requirements:
- File format: PNG or SVG only
- Recommended dimensions: At least 512x512 pixels for optimal display
- File size: Keep files under 5MB for best performance
</Warning>

### Advanced configuration

#### Custom interaction endpoint

By default, OpenID authentication flows direct users to a Rownd-hosted URL for sign-in. However, if you have Rownd integrated into your website or application, you can provide a custom interaction endpoint for a more streamlined experience.

When configured, users will be directed to your site/app instead of the default Rownd URL. This provides several benefits:
- Maintains your branded experience
- Leverages existing user sessions
- Reduces authentication steps when users are already logged in
- Provides a more seamless OIDC consent flow

##### Configuration

Add the `interaction_endpoint` to your OIDC client configuration under the `config` object:

```json
{
  "name": "Example OIDC Provider",
  "description": "Example OIDC Provider",
  "config": {
    "allowed_origins": [
      "https://example.com"
    ],
    "redirect_uris": [
      "https://example.com/callback"
    ],
    "post_logout_uris": [
      "https://example.com/logout"
    ],
    "interaction_endpoint": "https://example.com/auth",
    "logo_uri": "https://storage.rownd.io/logo-example.png",
    "logo_dark_mode_uri": "https://storage.rownd.io/logo-dark-example.png"
  }
}
```

<Note>
The interaction endpoint must be a page where the Rownd JavaScript snippet is properly installed and configured (a single-page app like React will also work). This ensures the authentication flow can properly handle the OpenID consent process.
</Note>

##### User flow example

1. User initiates OIDC sign-in from a third-party application
2. Instead of going to `hub.rownd.io`, they are redirected to your custom endpoint (e.g., `https://example.com/auth`)
3. If the user is already signed in on your site:
   - They only need to approve the OIDC consent
   - No additional authentication is required
4. If the user is not signed in:
   - They'll see your normal Rownd authentication flow
   - After signing in, they'll be prompted for OIDC consent
5. After consent, they are redirected back to the original application

This approach can significantly reduce friction in the authentication process, especially for users who frequently interact with your platform.
