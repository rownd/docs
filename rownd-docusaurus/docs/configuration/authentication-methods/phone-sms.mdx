SMS-based authentication using Rownd Sign-in Links is a secure and convenient method for users to sign in to their accounts on your website and mobile apps. This approach eliminates the need for passwords, instead sending a unique, one-time-use sign-in link directly to users' mobile devices via SMS. By simply clicking on the link, users can securely access their accounts without having to remember any passwords.

**Enhance SMS Link Trust with Custom Domains**

Using a custom domain for your SMS authentication links can significantly improve user trust and click-through rates. When users receive links that contain your own domain rather than a generic one, they're more likely to perceive them as legitimate and click through.
