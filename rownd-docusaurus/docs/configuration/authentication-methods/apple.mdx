## Configuring Sign in with Apple

Using Rownd to add "Sign in with Apple" to your app is quick and easy, usually requiring no code changes. Our implementation supports iOS, Android, and web clients so no matter how your users are accessing your app or service, they can always sign in with their method of choice.

To enable Sign-in with Apple, complete the following steps.

#### Configuring Xcode and an Apple Services ID

1. If you're developing an iOS or macOS app, enable the **Sign in with Apple** capability in Xcode. [See Apple's documentation for more information.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app)
2. Create an [Apple Services ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) for your app. Note the identifier for use in the next step. Ensure that this Callback URL is set within the Services ID: `https://api.rownd.io/hub/auth/apple/callback`

#### Configuring Rownd

Now, open your app in the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io/applications). Then click on the **Sign-in methods** tab on the left to adjust your flow.

That's it! Your app and/or website is now ready to handle sign-in requests for users with an Apple ID.
