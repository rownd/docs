While Rownd provides a superior authentication experience for most users, there may be occasions where end-users need to authenticate with a third-party system. 

This can be especially important when dealing with corporate SSO requirements. CISO policy may require that all users sign in through an in-house identity provider or an enterprise cloud provider like Microsoft or Google. (If you're looking for Google authentication, we highly recommend using our [built-in Google authentication method.](./google))

Follow the steps below to configure Rownd to interoperate with your target OpenID or OAuth2 server.

If you require a SAML authentication flow, please [get in touch](mailto:support@rownd.io).

## Supported flows

Rownd supports the following authentication flows:
- Authorization code flow
- Authorization code flow with proof key for code exchange (PKCE)
- Authorization code flow with JWT-secured authorization requests

## Configuring an OpenID or OAuth2 client

Before getting started, be sure you obtain a valid client ID and--if required--client secret or private key from your OAuth provider.

1. From the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io), navigate to the **Sign-in methods** sidebar tab.
2. In the *Additional sign-in methods* section, select **Enable additional methods**.
3. From the *Add additional sign-in methods* dialog, locate the **Custom** option and select **Add**.
4. Enter a name for the authentication method (e.g., My SSO provider) and optionally upload light and dark mode icons that will represent this authentication method.
5. Select the type of authentication flow: OpenID or OAuth2.
6. *(Required for OpenID)* Provide the issuer's base URL which hosts the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint (e.g., `https://auth.mycorp.com`).
7. Provide the default scopes that should be included in every authentication request. You can conditionally include additional scopes at authentication time.
8. Click **Next** to continue to the next step.
9. Enter your **Client ID**
10. If applicable, select the type of *client authentication* your provider requires and then paste the authentication secret in the provided input.
11. *(OAuth2 only)* Provide applicable values for the various authorization server endpoints (e.g., authorization endpoint, token endpoint, JWK endpoint, etc).
12. Press **Enable** at the bottom of the dialog to add the sign-in method to your available authentication options. The dialog will close.
13. Press **Save** at the top-right of the window to persist your changes.
