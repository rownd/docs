The Auth0 integration helps you migrate your user authentication from Auth0 to Rownd. The migration can be done in one sync operation or on-demand as users sign-in. Existing Auth0 users will maintain their user IDs in Rownd.

#### Creating the integration

1. From the **Integrations** tab in the sidebar, click on the **Add Integration** button.
2. Choose the **Auth0** connector from the Connector Catalog
3. Enter a name for your new integration. After you've entered a descriptive name, click **Next**
4. Enter your client credentials and environment domain

    <Info>
    The client credentials that you provide must be for a "Machine-to-Machine" application. Rownd uses these credentials to make calls to the Auth0 Management API to lookup user info. Find out more about creating the client credentials [here.](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/machine-to-machine-apps)
    </Info>

When the connection is ready, you can use the three-dots menu on the far right of the row to attach the connection to your app.

Once these steps are completed, you should be able to use Rownd to sign in as an existing Auth0 user, receiving the same ID that you had previously.
