4. Click **Create** to create the connection.

The dialog should indicate that the integration was created successfully. Now that the connection exists, we need to attach it to an application.

#### Attach to an application

1. From the Integrations table, click the overflow icon on your new Integration
   and select **Attach to application**

2. Choose the application from the selector and click **Next**

3. Map data between the Rownd application and your new Integration

<Info>
A mapping for the `email` field is required. Rownd uses this field to identify
and search for existing subscribers in your Hubspot account. Rownd can only manage fields for which you have provided a mapping.

4. Click **Save.**

After a moment, the attached application should appear in the row next to the
connection. Once this occurs, data updates should begin flowing through the
integration.
