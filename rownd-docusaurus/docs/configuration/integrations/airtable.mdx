The Rownd integration for Airtable lets you sync personal information between
Rownd and a single Airtable Table. When configured, PII stored in the Table will
be discoverable and manageable by the data owners.

#### Creating the integration

1. From the **Integrations** tab in the sidebar, click on the **Add
   Integration** button. If this is your first time creating an integration,
   you'll already be in the Connector Catalog and don't need to click the
   button.

2. Choose the **Airtable** connector from the Connector Catalog

3. Enter a name for your new Integration.

After you've entered a descriptive name, click **Next**

1. Authenticate with Airtable

Enter an API key that Rownd can use for reading and writing to Airtable. You can
create or retrieve your API key from the Airtable
[account settings](https://airtable.com/account) under the **API** heading.

Click the **Next** button after entering your API key.

1. Airtable Settings

Select the Airtable Base and Table

When done, click **Next**

1. Last Modified Time Field

In this step, Rownd will check for the existence of a `lastModifiedTime` Field
within your chosen Table. This is a special field type that Airtable uses to
record the last time an entry in the Table was updated. if necessary, please add
this Field (with any name) to your Table and click the **Retry** button.
Otherwise, click **Create** to finish.

For more inormation on adding a `lastModifiedTime` Field, please check out the
[Airtable Documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022745493-Last-modified-time-field)

Click the **Create** button to finish creating your Integration

**Attach your Integration to a Rownd Application**

After creating your Integration, you must attach it to an existing Rownd
application.

1. From the Integrations table, click the overflow icon on your new Integration
   and select **Attach to application**

2. Choose the application from the selector and click **Next**

3. Map data between the Rownd application and your new Integration

You will see a list of all fields that exist in your chosen application's
schema. Choose the corresponding Field within your Airtable Table.

For instance, you could have a field in your Rownd application called
`first_name` and a corresponding Field in your Table called `firstName`. Choose
the `firstName` options in the dropdown next to `first_name`.

A mapping for the `email` field is required. Rownd uses this field to identify
and search for users.

Rownd can only manage fields for which you have provided a mapping. Therefore,
define as many mappings as possible to get the most value from Rownd.

Once you complete the mapping, click **Save**.
