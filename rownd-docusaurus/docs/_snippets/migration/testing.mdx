## Test the migration
Once everything is set up, it's time to test various aspects of the migration. Here are some things to consider:

1. Make sure new users can sign in successfully. If you use an email provider that supports sub-addressing, you can make up "new" users like `juliet+test1@gmail.com` and the messages will be delivered to `juliet@gmail.com`.

2. Verify existing users can sign in successfully and that they receive the same user ID that they had prior to the migration.

3. If you chose to keep existing users signed in, test the migration flow to ensure that you remain signed in throughout the process. This usually means loading or installing the previous version of your product, signing in with your old provider, then loading the Rownd-enabled version of the app.
