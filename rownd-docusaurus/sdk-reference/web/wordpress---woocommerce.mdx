When you install the Rownd plugin for WordPress, you'll bring our powerfully
simple authentication and user account capabilities into your website, blog, or
e-commerce site.

Rownd integrates with the existing WordPress user management system, which means
we're compatible with WooCommerce and many other WordPress addons!

Whether you're accepting user signups already or want to start, Rownd makes it
ultra-simple to get visitors and customers up and running quickly. Easily
trigger our sign-in dialog by setting some HTML data attributes in your code or
writing some simple Javascript and we'll handle getting your users verified and
signed in using our unique, passwordless approach.

## To get started, you'll need:

1.  A free [Rownd account](https://app.rownd.io)

2.  A Rownd [app key](https://docs.rownd.io/configuration/app-credentials)

3.  Add [allowed web origins](https://docs.rownd.io/security/attack-mitigation/domain-allow-list#configuring-the-domain-allow-list)

Once you install this plugin, drop your app key and secret into our settings and
you'll be good to go!
