Use this library to integrate Rownd into your Node.js application. Convenience
wrappers are provided for common server implementations.

### Installation

```bash
npm i @rownd/node
```

### Supported frameworks

In addition to supporting Node.js generally, the SDK also provides direct support for the following frameworks:

- [Express](#express)

### Usage

### Vanilla JS (Node.js)

The SDK exposes the following methods to help you validate user tokens, create or update user records, generate sign-in links, and so on.

Here's a basic usage example:

```js
const Rownd = require("@rownd/node");

const rownd = Rownd.createInstance({
  app_key: 'YOUR_ROWND_APP_KEY',
  app_secret: 'YOUR_ROWND_APP_SECRET'
});

try {
  // Receive a Rownd bearer token within your request headers (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>)
  let token = headers['authorization'].replace(/^bearer /i, '');

  let tokenInfo = await rownd.validateToken(token);
  // Available properties: decoded_token, user_id, access_token (the same token you passed into `validateToken()`)

  // If you want to grab the user's profile from Rownd
  let userInfo = await rownd.fetchUserInfo({ user_id: tokenInfo.user_id });

  console.log(userInfo.data); // Print user profile to console
} catch (err) {
  // Something went wrong--probably the token was invalid, expired, etc.
}

```

#### Express

An `authenticate` function is provided for use as Express middleware. It takes
the usual `req, res, next` arguments and will call `next()` if authentication
succeeds or `next(err)` if it fails.

Upon successful authentication, the request will be augmented with a `tokenInfo`
property containing details about the authenticated token. `req.isAuthenticated`
will also be set to `true`.

Each user's information is cached in memory for a short period of time to speed
up subsequent requests.

See the Express example for a working implementation.

Here's an example protecting one route:

```js
const { rownd } = require("@rownd/node");
const { authenticate } = rownd.express;

app.get("/protected-route", authenticate(), (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    message: "You are authenticated!",
    tokenObj: req.tokenObj,
  });
});
```

Here's an example protecting multiple routes on a certain path prefix:

```js
const { rownd } = require("@rownd/node");
const { authenticate } = rownd.express;
```

app.use('/protected-path', authenticate());

The `authenticate()` function accepts an optional `options` object containing
the following properties:

- `fetchUserInfo: boolean (default: false)` \- If `true`, the user's data will
  be fetched from the Rownd API and annotated on the request object as
  `req.user`. When present, it will contain a set of key/value pairs that match
  your application's schema. The user's data will be cached for a short period
  of time to speed up subsequent requests.

- `errOnInvalidToken: boolean (default: true)` \- When `true`, the an error will
  be passed to `next(err)` if the token fails to validate. When `false`, the
  token will still be validated, but `next()` will be called without an error.
  `req.isAuthenticated` will be `false` and `req.tokenInfo` will be `null`.

## API reference

Most methods return a Promise that will resolve with the result of the call or will reject (throw) if an error occurs, so you should be prepared to handle any errors.

### Rownd.createInstance(opts)

Creates a new instance of the Rownd client. It requires the following object properties as a single argument:
- `app_key` - Your Rownd application key.
- `app_secret` - Your Rownd application secret.

Optionally, you can also pass in the following properties:
- `timeout` - The number of milliseconds to wait before timing out a request. Defaults to 10 seconds. If you're on a slow network and see any "Request timed out" errors, try increasing this value.

Example:

```js
const rownd = Rownd.createInstance({
    app_key: 'YOUR_ROWND_APP_KEY',
    app_secret: 'YOUR_ROWND_APP_SECRET'
})
```

Once you have an instance, you can use it to call various Rownd APIs or leverage supported frameworks.

### instance.express
Provides convenience handlers for the Express framework. See the usage section on Express for more information on how to use it.

### `instance.validateToken(token: string): Promise<TTokenValidationPayload>`
Validates a Rownd bearer token. Returns a promise that resolves to a token validation payload.

In many cases, you'll retrieve a token from your REST API's `Authorization` header. Be sure to strip off the `Bearer ` portion of the header and just pass the raw token to this method.

If the validation is successful, the resulting object will look approximately like this:

```js
{
    decoded_token: {
        "jti": "345b7a0f-1ab4-482b-99e7-4466b1cac0ad",
        "aud": [
            "app:290167281732813315",
        ],
        "sub": "rownd|61f3053251f2420069455976",
        "iat": 1660056446,
        "https://auth.rownd.io/app_user_id": "71f6ceeb-ee0a-4437-9b44-e6229defbab8",
        "https://auth.rownd.io/is_verified_user": true,
        "iss": "https://api.dev.rownd.io",
        "exp": 1660060046
    },
    user_id: "71f6ceeb-ee0a-4437-9b44-e6229defbab8",
    access_token: "eyJhbGciOiJ....EluFfu9Dg",
}
```

### `instance.fetchUserInfo(opts: TFetchUserInfoOpts): Promise<TUserInfo>`
Retrieves a user's profile from Rownd containing fields that match your Rownd application's schema.

### `instance.createOrUpdateUser(user: TUser): Promise<void>`
Creates or updates a user's profile in Rownd. The user object must contain an `id` property. If the user already exists, the existing profile will be updated. If the user does not exist, a new user/profile will be created.

Example:

```js
let user = await instance.createOrUpdateUser({
    id: '71f6ceeb-ee0a-4437-9b44-e6229defbab8',
    data: {
        first_name: 'Juliet',
        email: 'juliet@rose.com'
    }
})
```

### `instance.deleteUser(userId: String): Promise<void>`
Deletes a user and all associated data from Rownd.

### `instance.createSignInLink(opts: CreateSignInLinkOpts): Promise<string>`

Creates a sign-in "magic" link that will automatically sign in a user based on their email address, phone number, etc when they click the link.

Example:

```js
let signInLink = await instance.createSignInLink({
    redirect_url: 'https://example.com/dashboard',
    email: 'juliet@rose.com',
    data: {
        first_name: 'Juliet',
    }
});
```
