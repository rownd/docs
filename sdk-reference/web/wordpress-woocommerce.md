description: Add Rownd to your WordPress site with a simple plugin
---

# WordPress / WooCommerce

When you install the Rownd plugin for WordPress, you'll bring our powerfully simple authentication and user account capabilities into your website, blog, or e-commerce site.

Rownd integrates with the existing WordPress user management system, which means we're compatible with WooCommerce and many other WordPress addons!

Whether you're accepting user signups already or want to start, Rownd makes it ultra-simple to get visitors and customers up and running quickly. Easily trigger our sign-in dialog by setting some HTML data attributes in your code or writing some simple Javascript and we'll handle getting your users verified and signed in using our unique, passwordless approach.

To get started, you'll need:

1. A free [Rownd account](https://app.rownd.io)
2. A Rownd app key

Once you install this plugin, drop your app key and secret into our settings and you'll be good to go!
