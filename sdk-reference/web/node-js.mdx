### Usage

#### Express

An `authenticate` function is provided for use as Express middleware. It takes
the usual `req, res, next` arguments and will call `next()` if authentication
succeeds or `next(err)` if it fails.

Upon successful authentication, the request will be augmented with a `tokenInfo`
property containing details about the authenticated token. `req.isAuthenticated`
will also be set to `true`.

Each user's information is cached in memory for a short period of time to speed
up subsequent requests.

See the Express example for a working implementation.

Here's an example protecting one route:

```js
const { rownd } = require("@rownd/node");
const { authenticate } = rownd.express;

app.get("/protected-route", authenticate(), (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    message: "You are authenticated!",
    tokenObj: req.tokenObj,
  });
});
```

Here's an example protecting multiple routes on a certain path prefix:

```js
const { rownd } = require("@rownd/node");
const { authenticate } = rownd.express;
```

app.use('/protected-path', authenticate());

The `authenticate()` function accepts an optional `options` object containing
the following properties:

- `fetchUserInfo: boolean (default: false)` \- If `true`, the user's data will
  be fetched from the Rownd API and annotated on the request object as
  `req.user`. When present, it will contain a set of key/value pairs that match
  your application's schema. The user's data will be cached for a short period
  of time to speed up subsequent requests.

- `errOnInvalidToken: boolean (default: true)` \- When `true`, the an error will
  be passed to `next(err)` if the token fails to validate. When `false`, the
  token will still be validated, but `next()` will be called without an error.
  `req.isAuthenticated` will be `false` and `req.tokenInfo` will be `null`.
