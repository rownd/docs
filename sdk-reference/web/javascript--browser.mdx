The Rownd SDK Javascript provides browser-based access to the Rownd platform. In
fact, you don't even need a backend server in order to authenticate users, save
their profile information, and so on.

## Getting started

1.  Get the Rownd Javascript code-snippet from the
    [Rownd dashboard](https://app.rownd.io).

    ```jsx
    // EXAMPLE ONLY--THIS WON'T WORK IN A REAL APP
    <script type="text/javascript">
    !function(){var e=window._rphConfig=window._rphConfig||[];let t=window.localStorage.getItem("rph_base_url_override")||"https://hub.rownd.io";e.push(["setBaseUrl",t]);var r=document,s=r.createElement("script")=r.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];s.type="text/javascript",s.async=!0,s.src=t+"/static/scripts/rph.js",a&amp;&amp;a.parentNode?a.parentNode.insertBefore(s,a):r.body.appendChild(s)}();
    </script>
    ```

2.  Add the snippet to your website. If you're using a CMS (e.g., WordPress,
    Webflow, Wix, etc.), you can typically add the snippet through the
    "settings" portion of their editors.  
     If you're testing locally or want to add the snippet directly to your site code,
    add the snippet to your main layout or template HTML file. Ideally, add the snippet
    just before the closing `</body>` tag.

### Deploying the Snippet to hosted websites

After copying the code snippet, you'll need to add it to your website(s). Most
website builder software or content management systems (CMS) have an option to
embed "custom HTML" or "custom code" in your site's pages. We usually recommend
placing the snippet just before the closing `</body>` tag.

Here are links to instructions for a few popular hosting providers. See our
[JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk-reference/web/javascript--browser) for more details.

- [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/snippet-injection/)
- [Squarespace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815908)
- [Webflow](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags)
- [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/app/help/us/en/topics/descriptions-and-keywords)â€‹ (see the section on "footer code")
- [Wix](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-about-embeds-and-codes-on-your-site#embed-custom-code)
- [WordPress](sdk-reference/web/wordpress---woocommerce)

At this point, if you load your site in a browser after saving or publishing,
you should see the Rownd Hub appear in the lower left-hand corner of the site.

If you're building a single-page app in React, Vue, etc, then use our
framework-specific [SDKs](https://docs.rownd.io/sdk-reference/web/overview) instead of these instructions.

If your single-page app is separate from your website, then you'll want to use
the instructions on this page for the website and the framework SDK instructions
for the single-page app.

If you find any of this unclear, get in touch with us and we can help you figure
out which pieces you'll need.

## Advanced
The following sections require some level of development knowledge

###  Configuring Rownd Behavior

The behavior of Rownd and Rownd's UI components is configurable by appending configuration parameters to the global `_rphConfig` object.

To set a config parameter, add an additional script block _after_ the main Rownd snippet. The important thing to see here is the call to `_rphConfig.push()`.

```jsx
<script type="text/javascript">
  _rphConfig.push(["set<config_variable_name>", "<value>"]);
</script>
```

**Configuration Parameters**

#### setAppKey

<Snippet file="web/params/app-key.mdx" />

<Info>This is usually part of the snippet obtained from the Rownd dashboard, so you don't need to set it here.</Info>

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setAppKey", "82f7fa9a-8110-416c-8cc8-e3c0506fbf93"]);
```

#### setPostLoginRedirect

<Snippet file="web/params/post-login-redirect.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostLoginRedirect", "https://app.rownd.io"]);
```

#### setPostRegistrationRedirect

<Snippet file="web/params/post-registration-redirect.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostRegistrationRedirect", "https://app.rownd.io/post-registration"]);
```

#### setPostAuthenticationApi

<Snippet file="web/params/post-authentication-api.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostAuthenticationApi",
  {
    method: "post",
    url: "https://api.acme.com/authenticate",
    extra_headers: {
      extra: "value"
    },
    timeout: 3000 // 3s
  }
]);
```

#### setPostSignOutApi

<Snippet file="web/params/post-sign-out-api.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostSignOutApi",
  {
    method: "post",
    url: "https://api.acme.com/sign-out",
    extra_headers: {
      extra: "value"
    },
  }
]);
```

#### setPostSignOutCallback

<Snippet file="web/params/post-sign-out-callback.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostSignOutCallback", function () {
  console.log('User signed out')
}]);
```

#### setPostUserDataUpdateApi

<Snippet file="web/params/post-user-data-update-api.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setPostUserDataUpdateApi",
  {
    method: "post",
    url: "https://api.acme.com/user_data_update",
    extra_headers: {
      extra: "value"
    },
  }
]);
```

#### setRootOrigin

<Snippet file="web/params/root-origin.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setRootOrigin",  "https://acme.com"]);
```

#### setLogLevel

<Snippet file="web/params/log-level.mdx" />

```jsx Example
_rphConfig.push(["setRootOrigin",  "trace"]);
```

### Programmatic API

In addition to the declarative markup described above, you can use the Rownd
Hub's programmatic API to create more advanced functionality.

#### The \`rownd\` object

Once the Rownd Hub initializes, it will place a `rownd` property on the global
`Window` object. All JS APIs are available on this object. Check out the JavaScript API reference [documentation](/sdk-reference/web/javascript--api-reference) for a comprehensive view of the API.

<Info>
Before calling methods or accessing data on the Rownd API, you'll need to wait
for the API to be ready. Start by adding a function to the configuration's
`onLoaded` event, like this:

You can interact with the Rownd JS Api

```jsx
<script type="text/javascript">
_rphConfig.push(['onLoaded', () => {
  // window.rownd should be available now!
  console.log(window.rownd);
});
</script>
```
</Info>

### Events

The Rownd Hub emits various events when state changes occur. For example,
initial authentication, updates to user data, etc. You can listen for these
event changes and react to them.

#### `auth`
The `auth` event fires any time the user moves from an
unauthenticated state to an authenticated state. It will also fire any time the
access token is refreshed.

```jsx
rownd.events.addEventListener("auth", (evt) => {
  const { access_token, user_id, app_id } = evt.detail;
});
```

#### `sign_out`
This event fires whenever a user is signed out.

```jsx
rownd.events.addEventListener('sign_out', () => {
    // do something now that the user has signed out
});
```

#### `user_data`
This evenf fires any time a user's profile data changes. This could fire due to calls to `rownd.user.set()`, `rowns.user.setValue()`, changes to profile data in the Rownd Hub UI, or due to data changes when authenticating.

```jsx
rownd.events.addEventListener("user_data", (evt) => {
  const { data } = evt.detail;
  console.log("first_name:", data.first_name);
});
```

### Hooks

With the JavaScript SDK installed, you can use all of the HTML hooks described in the [HTML Hooks](/sdk-reference/web/html) documentation.
