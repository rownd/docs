title: ".NET Core"

Use this library to integrate Rownd into your .NET Core web application.

Convenience wrappers are provided for the .NET Core Identity framework, but you
can also leverage token validation and

### Installation

From NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Rownd --prerelease
```

### Supported versions

- .NET 6.x

- _Need a different version?_
  [Let us know!](https://github.com/rownd/dotnet/issues/new)

### Usage

#### Prepare configuration values

The Rownd client requires an application key (which is publishable) and an
application secret (which should be kept private). If you don't have these
values, you can obtain them at https://app.rownd.io.

Once you have them, you can add them to your `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
    ...
    "Rownd": {
        "AppKey": "...",
        "AppSecret": "..."
    }
}
```

Or you can set environment variables and the library will use them automatically
(recommended):

```json
export ROWND\_APP\_KEY\="..."
export ROWND\_APP\_SECRET\="..."
```

#### Inject Rownd into your application

For the purposes of getting set up quickly, we'll assume you added the app key
and secret to your `appsettings.json` file as shown above.

Next, add the following to your `Program.cs` file before the `builder.build()`
statement:

```cs
using Rownd;

...

builder.Services.AddSingleton<Rownd.Models.Config>(sp => {
    return new Rownd.Models.Config(builder.Configuration["Rownd:AppKey"], builder.Configuration["Rownd:AppSecret"]);
});
builder.Services.AddSingleton<RowndClient>();
```

At this point, your server should accept Rownd JWTs and validate them. If you're
building a Single Page Application (SPA), you'll want to leverage our
framework-specific browser SDKs for ease of implementation.

If you're building a more traditional web application, keep reading...

#### Use Rownd with .NET Core Identity cookie-based sessions

If you're adding Rownd to an existing application or building a new one that
uses the default, cookie-based session handling that comes with .NET Core
Identity, you'll need to add an additional controller to your app that will
accept a Rownd JWT and set a session cookie in response.

Add a new controller that looks like this:

```cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Rownd;
using Rownd.Helpers;

namespace MyAppNamespace.Controllers
{
    [Route("/api/auth/rownd")]
    public class RowndAuthController : RowndCookieExchange
    {
        // OPTIONAL
        protected override async Task IsAllowedToSignIn(RowndUser rowndUser) {
            // Run any custom logic here to ensure this user should be allowed to sign in.

            // return; // if everything is fine

            // throw new Exception("You aren't allowed here!"); // if you want to prevent the user from signing in
        }

        public RowndAuthController(RowndClient client, ILogger<RowndAuthController> logger, UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager) : base(client, logger)
        {
            _userManager = userManager; // If provided, Rownd will attempt to match the incoming user with an existing user in the database.
            _addNewUsersToDatabase = true;  // If you want Rownd to add new users to the database when they're first authenticated, set this to `true` (requires `_userManager`)

            _defaultAuthenticationScheme = IdentityConstants.ApplicationScheme;  // Sets the authentication scheme (default: `IdentityConstants.ApplicationScheme`)
            _signOutRedirectUrl = "/";  // Where to redirect the user after signing out (default: "/")
        }
    }
}
```

Let's examine what's happening in the above code:

1.  We're using the `RowndCookieExchange` base class to handle the exchange of
    Rownd JWTs for a session cookie. It will accept a Rownd JWT in the POST
    body, call the `HttpContext.SignInAsync()` method with the user's email
    address and/or phone number and a role (if present).

2.  We're attaching a route to the controller (the base class is an abstract
    `ApiController`) that we'll use later to handle the exchange of Rownd JWTs
    for a session cookie. You can specify any route you like here, but
    `/api/auth/rownd` is a decent choice.

3.  Using .NET dependency injection (DI), the server injects references to the
    RowndClient and an ILogger (which are required). If you want Rownd to add
    users to your database, then you'll also need to accept a reference to a
    `UserManager` instance.

4.  `_addNewUsersToDatabase` is a protected, base class instance variable and is
    set to `false` by default. If you want Rownd to add users to your database,
    you'll need to set this to `true`. Likewise, `_userManager` is a protected,
    base class instance variable and is set to `null` by default. Be sure to
    populate this with the UserManager injected dependency if
    `_addNewUsersToDatabase` is `true`.

Finally, we need to install the Rownd Hub and instruct it to call our controller
API when the page loads.

1.  Follow
    [these instructions](https://docs.rownd.io/rownd/sdk-reference/web/javascript-browser)
    to install the Rownd Hub. You'll want to ensure it runs on every page of
    your application, so be sure to add it as a common script or drop it
    directly into your layout.

2.  Add the following script just below the Rownd Hub script:

        ```jsx
        _rphConfig.push(['setPostAuthenticationApi', {
        method: 'post',
        url: '/api/auth/rownd'  // Replace this with the route you specified in the controller
        }]);
        _rphConfig.push(['setPostSignOutApi', {
        method: 'delete',
        url: '/api/auth/rownd'  // Replace this with the route you specified in the controller
        }]);
        ```

That's it! At this point, you should be able to fire up your app in a browser,
sign in with Rownd, and navigate around your app.
