## Installation

Please reference one of Rownd's other [Web SDKs](/sdk-reference/web/overview) for instructions on installing Rownd onto your site or web app. The HTML Hooks functionality is available with any or our web SDKs.

## HTML Hooks

The Rownd Hub supports various hooks that can be used to modify the behavior of
content on a page. These are controlled by
[HTML data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use%5Fdata%5Fattributes).
The following attribute hooks are supported.

## Sign in / sign up buttons / triggers

### `data-rownd-sign-in-trigger`

Attach to a clickable control (e.g., `<a>` or `<button>`) to trigger the Rownd
authentication modal when not signed in.

Example:

```jsx
<a href="/dashboard" data-rownd-sign-in-trigger>
  Sign in
</a>
```

**`data-rownd-authenticated-text="<text>"`**

When the user is authenticated, the text in this attribute will replace the
element's original text.

Example:

```jsx
<a
  href="/dashboard"
  data-rownd-sign-in-trigger
  data-rownd-authenticated-text="Sign out"
>
  Sign in
</a>
```

**`data-rownd-authenticated-redirect-url="<url>"`**

When the user is authenticated, the clicked element will navigate the browser to
the specified absolute or relative URL. If not specified in the case of an `<a>`
tag, the `href` attribute from the tag will be used instead.

Example:

```jsx
<button
  data-rownd-sign-in-trigger
  data-rownd-authenticated-text="Sign out"
  data-rownd-authenticated-redirect-url="/dashboard"
>
  Sign in
</button>
```

**`data-rownd-request-sign-in`** / **`data-rownd-require-sign-in`**

When one of these attributes is present on any DOM element, the Rownd sign-in
modal will automatically display if the user is not currently signed in.

The only difference between the two is that `data-rownd-request-sign-in` will
display a closable sign-in modal (i.e., with a close icon showing) whereas
`data-rownd-require-sign-in` will display a persistent, non-closable modal until
the user successfully completes the sign-in process.

**Pre-set the user's email address or phone number**

If you already know the current visitor's sign-in identifier (i.e., email or
phone), Rownd can pre-populate that into the sign-in modal. Simply add the
following additional attribute to the same element where the request/require
sign-in attribute is present:
`data-rownd-default-user-identifier="REPLACE_WITH_EMAIL_OR_PHONE"`

Here's a complete example:

```jsx
<div
  data-rownd-require-sign-in="auto-submit"
  data-rownd-default-user-identifier="jrose@rownd.io"
/>
```

### Display user profile information for site customization

Use these hooks when you want to customize site content with information about
the currently signed-in user. The fields available here will match those
specified in the Rownd dashboard.

If the user's profile changes within the browser context, the changes will
automatically be reflected within the site.

**`data-rownd-field-interpolate`**

Replaces templated strings within the element's HTML content with the values
from the currently signed-in user's profile.

Example:

```jsx
<p data-rownd-field-interpolate>
  Hello, {{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}!
</p>

// Result: <p data-rownd-field-interpolate>Hello, Alice Remansi!</p>
```

**`data-rownd-field-mapping="<field name>"`**

Examples:

```jsx
<p>
  Hello,
  <span data-rownd-field-mapping="first_name"></span>
  <span data-rownd-field-mapping="last_name"></span>!
</p>;

Result: <p>
  {" "}
  Hello,
  <span data-rownd-field-mapping="first_name">Alice</span>
  <span data-rownd-field-mapping="last_name">Remansi</span>!
</p>;
```

Rownd can also render images when this attribute is applied to an `img` element
and the field name corresponds to a field of type "image". Example:

```jsx
<h3>Profile Picture</h3>
<img data-rownd-field-mapping="profile_picture" />
```
