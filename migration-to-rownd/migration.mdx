Whether you use Auth0, Stytch, or you built your own auth, moving can seem like an overwhelming task.   We are here to say it is not only possible, but straight forward. 

A few things to consider when leaving one auth providor.  First, the easy part is moving the data.  User profiles, emails, phone numbers, even google-IDs can be moved over to Rownd.  Second, keeping users "logged in" is worth considering.  This means you may have to have two auth providors for a little but, but not for very long.  

Let's dig in.

## Get Rownd set up
The first step is to get Rownd into your dev enviornment.  We have a plethra of SDKs and snippets to make this straight forward.  

### Considerations when setting up Rownd
1. **No login page**  Rownd is different, we don't need a login page.  We can be added to existing buttons or we can be triggered dynamically, your choice.

2. **No hard coding**.  Rownd renders its sign-in modal on the server-side, meaning that branding, authenticaton types, and more can be configured dynamitcally through the Rownd platform.  

3. **Move auth where you need it**.  Although some customers simply replace their login button with Rownd, try moving it deeper into the app.  Let you customers experience you app prior to hitting them with a sign-up. 

## Keeping users signed-in

[Rownd has a token validator](/configuration/integrations/token-validator) integration that can take an existing token and validate it against the pre-Ropwnd token validatin API. This allows users that are already logged in to stay logged in and Rownd will issue them a new Rownd token.  

### Considerations for Token Validaiton 
1. The API endpoint needs to be made public, so Rownd can send a token and get a valid or invalid response.
2. Each auth providor has their own methods for validating tokens. Reach out to support@rownd.io and we'll help you configure the providor to validate tokens to keep your users logged in.

## Setting up Google and/or Apple
If you already had [Google](/configuration/authentication-methods/google) or [Apple](/configuration/authentication-methods/apple) login, you can set them up quickly in Rownd.

### Considerations for setting up Google and/or Apple
1. Use the same Google App that you used to set up the pre-Rownd auth.  This ensures the google-ID stays the same. If it is not possible, Rownd will automatically link their email address to a new Google ID.  
2. Use the same Apple App ID for both. 

## Migrating data
Migrating existing user data is the easiest part.   A few days before the app goes live, contact the migration team at Rownd (migration@rownd.io) and we will help you through every step of the journey.  

### Considerations for Migrating Data
1. Consider what data you want to transfer to Rownd. Any login method should be migrated and Rownd can also manage other profile information (names, addresses, etc).
2. You may choose to migrate data from two or more sources. For example, you may move login data from Auth0 and PII from your database.  Let us know!
