Deploying Rownd should be a relatively straightforward process. It typically
involves a few steps:

- Select the initial user profile fields in the Rownd dashboard
- Deploy the Rownd snippet to your websites
- (optional) Add the Rownd SDK to front-end and back end apps/servers

<Info>
  By deploying Rownd to your main website, blog, docs, etc, you can begin
  onboarding users even before having an app. For example, if you're creating a
  waitlist for your product, Rownd can manage the sign-up process. You can even
  leverage Rownd to gradually on-ramp users to your app once it's ready for beta
  testers.

### Select initial user profile fields

1. Open the Rownd dashboard
2. Create your first application if prompted and select or create the desired
   profile fields: ​

3. After the app is created, a Javascript code snippet will be generated. Click
   the copy button to store it in your clipboard.

### Installing Rownd on your websites

The Rownd code snippet is a short block of javascript that you can embed into your site to enable Rownd contextual authentication. Once embedded, the snippet allows Rownd to handle user authentication, fetch user data, enforce [automations](/configuration/automations), and much more. 

Embedding the snippet will also display the Rownd Hub in the bottom left-hand corner of your website by default. Users can click on the Hub to view their profile information, sign out, and perform other account management actions. If you provide access to these actions through other elements of your UX, the Hub can be hidden.

#### Finding your snippet

You can find the snippet in the [Rownd Platform](https://app.rownd.io).

1. Select the **Code** item from the left navigation menu.
2. Press the **Copy** icon in the top right corner of the code box beneath **HTML snippet**.

#### Deploying the snippet

After copying the code snippet, you'll need to add it to your website(s). Most
website builder software or content management systems (CMS) have an option to
embed "custom HTML" or "custom code" in your site's pages. We usually recommend
placing the snippet just before the closing `</body>` tag.

### Add the Rownd SDK to front-end and back-end apps/servers

If you have front-end web apps built using common frameworks like React, Vue,
Angular, etc, you'll want to use our specific [Web SDKs](/web) for
those codebases. Our SDKs provide tight integrations to your user experience so
users can seamlessly transition from one part of your product to the
next—personalization included.

Additionally, if you're deploying back-end code to servers or are using a serverless platform like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to implement custom logic, you'll likely need to accept and validate Rownd authentication tokens. Leverage our selection of [back-end SDKs](/web) to easily handle this use case.

#### Further configuration and customization

See the [configuration guide](/configuration) for information on customizing authentication flows and behaviors to fit your needs.

Consult the [JavaScript SDK reference](/sdk-reference/web/javascript--browser) to learn how Rownd can help personalize your website's user experience.
