Open https://app.rownd.io to get started.  You'll have to sign in with Google or email. A starter app will be created for you.

## 2. Add your team
Getting users to sign up and stay engaged is a cross-domain task. [Add your teammates](/administration/teams): developers, product managers, security specialists, and growth teams. As you add Rownd to more sites, configuring automations and sub-brands will become more important.

## 4. Install Rownd
