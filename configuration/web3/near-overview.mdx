The NEAR Protocol is a scalable and user-friendly blockchain platform designed to power the next generation of decentralized applications. With its focus on simplifying the developer and user experience, NEAR is poised to drive mass-adoption of web3 technologies. 

Rownd's integration with NEAR addresses one of the most significant barriers to entry for new web3 users - the onboarding process. By automating wallet generation, securely storing private keys, and enabling seamless wallet management through each person's Rownd profile, users can easily interact with NEAR-based applications. This streamlined approach accelerates user onboarding, reduces friction, and fosters a more inclusive web3 ecosystem, empowering a wider audience to participate in the decentralized revolution.

The integration offers the following features:

- **Automatic wallet creation**<br />
   When the integration is configured, Rownd will automatically create a NEAR wallet for each user. This eliminates the need for users to manually create a wallet, streamlining the onboarding process and making it more user-friendly.

- **On-Demand wallet creation**<br />
   The integration can be configured so that a NEAR wallet is not created automatically upon user sign-in. In this
   configuration, you can manually trigger the creation of the NEAR wallet at any point. See our [examples page](/configuration/web3/near-examples).

- **Secure private key storage**<br />
   Rownd securely stores the private key associated with each user's NEAR wallet using double encryption. This ensures that the private key remains safe from unauthorized access, providing a high level of security for users' assets.

- **User wallet access**<br />
   Users can view their NEAR wallet balance and transaction history through the Rownd profile. This provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their wallet without needing to use a separate interface.

- **Named wallet creation**<br />
   With Rownd, users have the option to create a named wallet for their NEAR account. This makes it easy for users to remember their wallet addresses and share them with others for transactions.

- **Easy wallet attachment**<br />
   Users can easily attach a NEAR wallet to their Rownd account, making it simple to manage their blockchain assets alongside their other authentication methods.

- **NEAR wallet names retrieval**<br />
   Developers can retrieve the names of users' NEAR wallets through user-data queries. This allows for seamless integration with your application, enabling users to interact with their wallets directly within your app.
