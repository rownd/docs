<Note>
This is a limited beta feature. Please [contact us](mailto:support@rownd.io?subject=Please%20enable%20NEAR) if you're interested in using it.
</Note>

The Rownd NEAR integration ensures that all of your users have a NEAR account either automatically or on-dmand. 

## NEAR Examples

Here are some basic examples of using the Rownd SDK and APIs to interact with NEAR. See the [JavaScript API Reference](/sdk-reference/web/javascript--api-reference#near) for more details

### Trigger an implicit account creation

If you wish to control when NEAR implicit accounts are created for your users, you can opt for the "on-demand" creation 
strategy. This improves sign-up time since Rownd does not have to wait for the execution of on-chain contract calls to
complete. You will need to manually ensure that an implicit account exists for a user.

You can execute the following SDK call to ensure an implicit account exists

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Javascript
// accountId = "12a734486c485767d02a4747487573e69889a92618c4890328b0a18c6320898cd2"
const accountId = await rownd.near.ensureImplicitAccount();
```

```sh cURL
# Invoke the 'near.ensure-implicit-account` with the user's Rownd access token
curl 'https://api.rownd.io/hub/connection_action' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <USERS_BEARER_TOKEN>' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"action_type":"near.ensure-implicit-account"}'

# Result:
# {
#     "action_type": "ensure-implicit-account",
#     "result": "success",
#     "data": {
#         "near_implicit_account_id": "3df96ef4be51736d4d76f23c801954f72e8421a7751d4e2c44bc7cee35576a70"
#     }
# }
```
</CodeGroup>

## Prompt a user for named account creation

This call will open a dialog prompting the user to enter a name prior to creating the NEAR account. This name will end
with `.rownd.near` by default. For instance, if a user specifies `my-account-1`, the full account name will be
`my-account-1.rownd.near`. Work with the Rownd support team if you would like to change this account name suffix to
another value.

```javascript Javascript
rownd.near.createNamedAccount();
```

## Prompt a user to connect an account

This call will open a dialog prompting the user to connect a NEAR account. They will be presented with a list of supported wallet providers. Clicking on one of the providers will initiate a NEAR wallet sign-in, after which the NEAR account and wallet ID will be added to the Rownd user's profile data.

```javascript Javascript
rownd.near.connectAccount();
```
