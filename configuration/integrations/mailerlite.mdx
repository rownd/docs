3. Map data between the Rownd application and your new Integration

<Note>
A mapping for the `email` field is required. Rownd uses this field to identify
and search for existing subscribers in your MailerLite account. Rownd can only manage fields for which you have provided a mapping.
</Note>

4. Click **Save.**

After a moment, the attached application should appear in the row next to the
connection. Once this occurs, data updates should begin flowing through the
integration.
