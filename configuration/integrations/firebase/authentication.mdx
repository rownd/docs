The Firebase Authentication integration helps you migrate your user authentication flow from Firebase to Rownd. It also provides the means to use Rownd and Firebase Firestore together.

Before you begin, check out the Google Cloud [prerequisites](/configuration/integrations/firebase/google-cloud-platform-requirements)
to ensure your GCP account and Project are ready to integrate with Rownd.

#### Creating the integration

1. From the **Integrations** tab in the sidebar, click on the **Add
   Integration** button.

2. Choose the **Firebase - Authentication** connector from the Connector
   Catalog

3. Enter a name for your new integration.

After you've entered a descriptive name, click **Next**

1.  Authenticate with Google Cloud

Click the **Begin authenticate** button and sign in to your Google Account.

<Info>
Firebase Authentication runs on Google Cloud. Rownd leverages the Google
Cloud Platform to receive updates from Firebase as any users are created, modified, or deleted. Rownd will need permission to read Google Cloud Projects, read and write Firebase resources, and create
Cloud Functions. For a full list of access that Rownd
needs, click
[here](/rownd/guides/configuration/integrations/firebase/google-cloud-platform-requirements#access-requirements).
</Info>

Grant Rownd the access into your Google Account, and then click the **Next**
button when authentication is complete.

1.  Firebase Settings

Select the Google Cloud Project, Firebase Application, and Firebase Database
where you'd like to enable Rownd.

When done, click **Next**
