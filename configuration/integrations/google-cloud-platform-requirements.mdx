#### Prerequisites

Rownd leverages the power of the Google Cloud Platform to configure the
automated sync between Rownd and the Firebase Realtime Database instance. As
such, there are prerequisites that Rownd requires prior to setting up a new
integration.

**Billing Account**

The GCP Project where your Realtime Database instance resides must have an
associated billing account enabled. Go
[here](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account) for
help establishing a billing account.

**Permissions**

Rownd will request access to your GCP account via OAuth 2.0 scopes during the
authentication step. You must have and provide sufficient permissions to satisfy
Rownds's request. See the
`\[Access Requirements\]({{< ref "\_index.md#access-requirements" >}})` section
below for a full list of permissions that Rownd needs.

#### Access Requirements

Rownd will need the following Google Cloud Platform permissions to create and
run the Cloud Functions that alert Rownd of changes in your Firebase Realtime
Database instance
