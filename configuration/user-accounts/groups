### What are Groups?

In Rownd, groups are user segments designed for apps with larger accounts, offering multiple-user access. This feature resembles a workspace group in Slack or a Google workspace group. Users become part of a larger account within a Rownd group, which can be created via API calls in your app or manually from the Rownd platform.

#### Why Use Groups?
- **Team Collaborations**: Suitable for apps promoting user collaboration within groups or shared account spaces. Users can invite others or create new groups within your app.
- **Role-Based Access**: Segment users based on roles for access to role-specific information (e.g., staff, admin, student).

### How it works 
1. From the "Users" tab in the Rownd platform, go to the "Groups" tab to view, manage, and add groups.

2. Add a group: Use the "add" dropdown button from the groups tab and click "add new group." Name your group and determine whether an invitation is required to join. Open groups are suitable for public roles, while invitation-required groups are better for private roles.

4. After adding a group, click "view" to see its contents and members.

5. Add users manually or use Rownd APIs to integrate the invite flow into your app. Provide an email or phone number, select the member's role, and include a link path for the user. Currently, you can only add one user at a time from the Rownd platform.

6. After adding a member, copy the provided invite link. Use this link to manually invite users to the app group, as invites are not sent automatically. Exercise caution, as the link serves as both an invite and sign-in link.

7. Manage members from the group’s page. All users in all groups will appear in the "users" table in the users tab on the platform. Once a user becomes part of a group, that group will appear in their Rownd account.

8. To delete a group from the platform, either use the trash icon in the group line item in the groups table or press “Delete this group” from the specific group’s page.

9. Edit a group name by clikcing on the 'Edit' icon on the card under your Group's name in a group page.


### Rownd Groups API Commands (these cards would link/point to sections in the API reference docs that need to be written) 

Use the following Rownd API references to enhance group functionality within your app, including:

<CardGroup>
  <Card
    title="Invite user to a group"
    href="/configuration/user-accounts/hub-user-profiles.mdx">
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Create a new group"
    href="/configuration/user-accounts/progressive-profiles.mdx">
  </Card>
   <Card
    title="Remove user from a group"
    href="/configuration/user-accounts/platform-user-table.mdx">
  </Card>
   <Card
    title="Delete a group"
    href="/configuration/user-accounts/platform-user-table.mdx">
  </Card>
   <Card
    title="What am i missing add here plese "
    href="/configuration/user-accounts/platform-user-table.mdx">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Coming Soon
Expect groups UI options in the future. We plan to provide functionality and a user interface for managing groups, creating, removing, and inviting users to groups within your app.
