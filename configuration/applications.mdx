  "Rownd applications connect to your product(s) to provide Rownd authentication
  to your users."

A Rownd application contains a unique code snippet that, when injected across
your product, provides user authentication to your platform. Within your Rownd
application, you can define and customize authentication methods, data types,
and more. You can also connect a Rownd application to your existing tools with
Integrations. It is likely that one Rownd application is enough to span all
aspects of your product, but you can create multiple Rownd apps in your account
as needed.

Your application name is used in all verification messages used to authenticate
your users. We recommend using the name of your company or product for your
application name.

Not seeing the application you're looking for?

- Try ‘switching accounts’ in the top right dropdown menu to see if the
  application you are looking for is associated with a different account

- Are you signed in with the correct email? It’s possible that the application
  you are looking for is associated with a different email. Try signing out and
  signing back in with the email that might have that application on it.

#### Delete an application

If you wish to delete an application, you can delete it from the overview tab.

1. In the Overview tab, click on the vertical overview menu, and select
   “Delete.”

2. In the modal that appears, confirm you want to delete the app by selecting
   “Delete app.”

Deleting your Rownd application completely removes all application data from
Rownd. If the application is being used to authenticate users in your product,
deleting will prevent all future sign ups and sign ins via Rownd.
