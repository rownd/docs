The sign in prompt automation allows you to encourage users to sign in based on clicks, time duration, sessions, or an entire page. Connect this prompt to a sign-in button or an app feature requiring authentication.

#### Sign in prompt use cases 

* **Content Gating**: Enhance user engagement by implementing click-triggered sign-in prompts within your application. These prompts allow users to explore your app freely, only requesting sign-in when specific elements are clicked. For example, if you wish to restrict access to certain features for unauthenticated users, seamlessly integrate a Rownd sign-in prompt to the corresponding tab or element in your app. This process takes just minutes to implement, encouraging users to sign in to access exclusive content.

* **Free Trials**: Provide prospective users with the opportunity to experience your product through free trials without the initial sign-up requirement. Utilize time-based sign-in prompts to prompt users to sign in after a defined period, whether it's 5 minutes, 24 hours, or 4 daysâ€”flexibility tailored to your needs. Time-based prompts allow users ample time to familiarize themselves with your product, generating excitement and increasing the likelihood of conversion when prompted to sign up.

* **Simple Buttons**: Simplify the process of integrating sign-in functionality into your website, even when your development team has limited availability. Sign-in prompts empower you to connect sign-in actions to any button or element seamlessly. Additionally, you can redirect users to specific destinations after they sign in, providing complete control over their post-login journey.


#### How does it work? 

1. **Create a New Sign-In Prompt Automation**

   Begin by adding a new Sign-In Prompt Automation from the "Automations" tab.

2. **Configure Your Automation**

   Tailor your automation to fit your use case. Determine the type of prompt you require, whether it's click-triggered, time-based, page-scoped, or immediately after sign-in. Define any specific requirements and redirect links.

  For click-triggered prompts on websites and web apps, you'll need to provide an element selector to connect to your Rownd automation. Refer to the video below for guidance on finding and copying an element selector.
