## Adaptive sign-in with Rownd

Rownd's adaptive sign-in feature offers a tailored authentication experience for users by adapting the sign-in method depending on the user's device. This versatile approach ensures the most convenient and secure authentication option is presented, enhancing the user experience and promoting increased user engagement.

### Device-specific sign-in methods

Rownd's adaptive sign-in can detect the user's device and adjust the available authentication options accordingly. This ensures that the user is presented with the most appropriate sign-in method for their device, resulting in a seamless and intuitive experience. Some device-specific sign-in methods include:

- **Biometric authentication:** Rownd utilizes passkey technology to automatically utilize whatever biometric featuers a device has. For devices with biometric capabilities, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, Rownd can offer these secure and convenient methods as authentication options.
- **Device-based authentication:** For users with device-specific accounts (e.g., Apple ID or Google accounts), Rownd can present the option to sign in using these platform-specific accounts.
- **SMS or email authentication:** For devices without biometric or device-based options, Rownd can provide authentication via SMS or email, sending a unique, one-time-use login link to the user's mobile device or email address.

### Customizing sign in methods by device on the Rownd platform 
1. **Navigate to the Sign in methods tab:** After installing Rownd with a code snippet or SDK, navigate to the sign in methods tab in the Rownd Platform.

2. **Configure [mobile app settings](configuration/mobile.mdx):** If you have a mobile app, configure your Google, Apple and mobile settings to get started. This will ensure proper deep linking to your mobile apps with your new customizations.

3. **Customize sign in method orders by device:** Select the device type at the top (Desktop, iOS, Android), drag, drop, prioritize, and hide methods until youâ€™re liking your customizations for each device type. We recommend prioritizing Apple sign in on iOS devices and prioritizing Google sign in on Android devices.
