## Adaptive sign-in with Rownd

Rownd's adaptive sign-in feature offers a tailored authentication experience for users by adapting the sign-in method depending on the user's device. This versatile approach ensures the most convenient and secure authentication option is presented, enhancing the user experience and promoting increased user engagement.

### Device-specific sign-in methods

Rownd's adaptive sign-in can detect the user's device and adjust the available authentication options accordingly. This ensures that the user is presented with the most appropriate sign-in method for their device, resulting in a seamless and intuitive experience. Some device-specific sign-in methods include:

- **Biometric authentication:** Rownd utilizes passkey technology to automatically utilize whatever biometric featuers a device has.  For devices with biometric capabilities, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, Rownd can offer these secure and convenient methods as authentication options.
- **Device-based authentication:** For users with device-specific accounts (e.g., Apple ID or Google accounts), Rownd can present the option to sign in using these platform-specific accounts.
- **SMS or email authentication:** For devices without biometric or device-based options, Rownd can provide authentication via SMS or email, sending a unique, one-time-use login link to the user's mobile device or email address.

### Customizing Sign in methods by device on the Rownd platform 
- **Navigate to the Sign in methods tab:** After installing Rownd with a code snippet or SDK, navigate to the sign in methods tab in the Rownd Platform.

- **Configure [mobile app settings](configuration/mobile.mdx):** If you have a mobile app, configure your Google, Apple and mobile settings to get started. This will ensure proper deep linking to your mobile apps with your new customizations.

- **Customize sign in method orders by device:** Select the device type at the top (Desktop, iOS, Android), drag, drop, prioritize, and hide methods until you’re liking your customizations for each device type. We recommend prioritizing Apple sign in on iOS devices and prioritizing Google sign in on Android devices.
