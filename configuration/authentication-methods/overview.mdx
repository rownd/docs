### Device-specific sign-in methods

Rownd's adaptive sign-in can detect the user's device and adjust the available authentication options accordingly. This ensures that the user is presented with the most appropriate sign-in method for their device, resulting in a seamless and intuitive experience. Some device-specific sign-in methods include:

- **Biometric authentication:** Rownd utilizes passkey technology to automatically utilize whatever biometric featuers a device has.  For devices with biometric capabilities, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, Rownd can offer these secure and convenient methods as authentication options.
- **Device-based authentication:** For users with device-specific accounts (e.g., Apple ID or Google accounts), Rownd can present the option to sign in using these platform-specific accounts.
- **SMS or email authentication:** For devices without biometric or device-based options, Rownd can provide authentication via SMS or email, sending a unique, one-time-use login link to the user's mobile device or email address.

### Benefits of adaptive sign-in

Implementing Rownd's adaptive sign-in feature in your mobile app provides several advantages:

1. **Improved user experience:** By offering device-specific sign-in methods, you can cater to users' preferences and provide a more convenient and intuitive authentication process.
2. **Increased security:** Adaptive sign-in ensures that the most secure method available on the user's device is presented, helping to safeguard user accounts and protect sensitive data.
3. **Higher engagement and retention:** A tailored authentication experience can lead to higher user engagement and retention, as users are more likely to continue using an app that offers a seamless and convenient sign-in process.
