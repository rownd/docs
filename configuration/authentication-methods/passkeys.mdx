Passkeys offer a secure and convenient method for users to sign in to their accounts on your website and mobile apps. By enabling passkeys, users with passkey-enabled devices can save their passkeys to their account. Once a passkey is saved, users can quickly sign in using their passkeys, providing a seamless and efficient experience.

## Enabling passkeys
Enabling passkeys is easy and does not require any additional code. Simply follow the steps below to enable passkeys for your application.

1. Open your app in the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io/applications). Then click on the **Sign-in methods** tab on the left to adjust your flow.

   <Info>
    At this time, passkey cannot be the only form of sign-in enabled. Users can add passkeys after signing up with another method. After the first sign-in, they can use their passkeys to sign in to their account. This ensures account access across different devices.

3. To confirm your changes, press **Save** in the upper right-hand corner of the page.

With passkeys enabled, users with passkey-enabled devices can now enjoy a seamless and secure sign-in experience on your website and mobile apps.
