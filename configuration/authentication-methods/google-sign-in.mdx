### Prerequisites

Before you turn on Google Sign-in, you'll need to do a few things in the Google
Cloud Platform.

#### OAuth Web Client ID

Use
[these instructions](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222992?hl=en)
from Google to create an OAuth web client ID. You'll need this client ID to
configure Rownd for all deployments regardless of web or mobile app.

The OAuth client ID's **Authorized JavaScript Origins** should contain any sites
on which you will embed Rownd and support Google Sign-in. If you are only using
Rownd on your mobile apps, you can leave this list empty

#### OAuth iOS Client ID (optional)

If you are adding Rownd to an iOS app, you'll need to create another OAuth
client ID. In the Google Cloud Platform you can create one just like before, but
this time, set the application type to "iOS". You'll be asked to provide your
app's bundle ID, App Store ID, and team ID.

When you finish creating the client ID, take note of the **iOS URL Scheme**
value. You will need this later when adding a custom URL scheme to your iOS app.

This value will be the reversed client ID value and look something like this:

```
com.googleusercontent.apps.224565757208-05divavgck1qgqg9b58piodfhqb55h90
```

[documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#zippy=%2Cnative-applications%2Cios)

#### OAuth Android Client ID (optional)

If you are adding Rownd to an Android app, you'll need one more OAuth client ID.
Use an existing one or create a new one in the Google Cloud Platform just the
same as before with your web or iOS client ID. When creating, make sure to
select the "Android" application type. Provide your app's package name and SHA-1
fingerprint.

[documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#zippy=%2Cnative-applications%2Candroid)

### Enabling Google Sign-in

Once you have completed the prerequisites, you can configure Rownd to enable
Google Sign-in.

Navigate to the [Rownd Platform](https://app.rownd.io), and make sure your
desired application is chosen in the application switcher.

Scroll down to view the authentication methods, and click **Configure** next to
**Google**

On the configuration screen, enter the following information

- **Google OAuth Client ID** \- Enter your OAuth web client ID that you created
  as the first prerequisite step

- **Google OAuth Client Secret -** Enter the client secret associated with your
  OAuth web client ID

- **Google iOS OAuth Client ID** \- Enter your OAuth iOS client ID that you
  created as a prerequisite

- **Google OAuth Scopes** \- (Optional) Enter additional OAuth scopes that you
  would like to request from the user during authentication. By default Rownd
  will request `email` and `profile`. Most of the time, you don't need to
  provide a value in this field.

If you are using Rownd on an Android app, you do not need to configure your
Android Client ID in the Rownd platform. Google uses the package name and SHA-1
fingerprint that you provided when creating the OAuth client ID to authenticate
your app.

#### One Last thing for iOS Apps

When Google finishes signing in a user, it calls back into your app on a custom
URL scheme. You'll need to define this inside your XCode project settings.

1. Click on your project in XCode, and then select your app under **TARGETS**

2. Next, go to the **Info** tab and scroll down to the bottom of the view where
   you see **URL Types**

3. Expand **URL Types** and click the **+** icon to add a new value

4. Set the **URL Schemes** value to the URL Scheme (reversed iOS Client ID)
   value that you noted when creating the OAuth iOS client ID earlier. Again,
   this value will look something like:
   `com.googleusercontent.apps.422565757208-05dqvvigck1qgqg9b58piodfhqb55h90`

That's it! In the end, it should look like this:

You'll need to publish this new version of your app before turning on Google
Sign-in in the Rownd Platform.

### Finishing up

At this point, you're all done! Make sure you save the Google configuration
inside of the Rownd Platform. When you are ready to turn it on, click the toggle
to enable Google Sign-in. Your users will then see a new option in the Rownd
sign in dialog to continue with Google.
