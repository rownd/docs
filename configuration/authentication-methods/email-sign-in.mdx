#### When to use email sign-in.

Rownd email sign-in is one of the easiest ways to add authentication to a website or app. Instead of having users create an insecure or hard-to-remember password, they simply enter their email address and verify it by clicking on a button in an email that Rownd automatically sends out. 

#### Navigating to the Email Authentication method

Toggle Email to "Allow for Authentication."

Rownd allows customers to edit the email template and call to action for email authentication

**From Field:** The email will be FROM the name of your application. [Update your application name](/rownd/guides/configuration/applications#edit-an-application) to change the "from" field. **Logo:** Upload a custom logo to display in emails. 

Logos must be .png of .jpg and must NOT have any special characters in the file name (ie, -, \_, $, etc)

**Email Verification Subject Line:** This is what your user will see in their inbox. Tip is to keep it simple and straightforward forward "Verify and sign in". **Email Verification Content:** The text in the body. Again, keep it simple.

**Button Text:** The actual call to action on the button. 

**From Address:** By default, this will come from Rownd. If you want to customize the From Address, please contact Rownd Support at support@rownd.io.
