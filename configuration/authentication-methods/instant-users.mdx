Instant Users captures visitors as users when they land on your website, web app, or mobile app. Are your users seeing the value in your product before they are forced to sign up? With Instant Users, you don't have to worry about this. Our Instant users feature ensures users can explore and experience your app without barriers, making it easier for them to see the value and commit to signing up when they're ready.


## Enabling Instant Users
Enabling Instant Users is easy and does not require any additional code. Simply follow the steps below to enable Instant Users for your application.


1. Open your app in the [Rownd platform](https://app.rownd.io). Click on the **Settings** tab on the left to adjust your flow and then select the "User Settings" tab.

2. Toggle on "Instant Users" and the cleanup timeline.  This is how long of inactivity before instant users are "cleaned up". Every use-case is different and our default i 30 days.

3. To confirm your changes, press **Save** in the upper right-hand corner of the page.


## The User Spectrum
Instant users is the first step along the Rownd User Spectrum. An instant user gets granted a JWT, that JWT has a normal lifecycle and security, and the goal is to show your user enough of your app and get them comfortable aenough to either login as a guest, enter a piece of verifiable data, or login with a verifiable email or phone number (either manually or through a social sign-in)


### The Spectrum:


1. **Instant user**: Upon initial visit, a new visitor receives a user ID as they move through your app, starting as a partial profile.


2. **Guest user**: Visitors can continue as guests, maintaining progress and exploring your app without immediate sign-up.


3. **Unverified user**: Users can provide an email without verification, reducing friction and allowing continued app use.


4. **Verified user**: Eventually, users provide verifiable information, like an email or Google account, to fully sign up and re-access their account.
