#### Mobile App Sign-in overview

Mobile app sign-in creates a golden path for mobile app download. Instead of losing context when a user goes to download an app, in the Rownd-led flow, they sign-up, authenticate, download the app, and are automatically signed in. The user profile data is already configured and they can start interacting with the app. 

Note: The [Rownd Mobile SDK](/rownd/sdk-reference/mobile) must be installed to use this method.
