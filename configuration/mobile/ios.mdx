1. Select **Sign-in methods** from the left navigation menu.
2. In the Sign-in preferences section, locate **Mobile app settings**
3. Fill out mobile app settings for iOS
    - Subdomain (e.g., myapp for myapp.rownd.link - the .rownd.link portion is added automatically).
    - App store URL - The direct link to your app in the Apple App Store
    - Bundle IDs - A comma-separated list of bundle IDs for your app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`)
    - Team ID - The team ID for your app as shown in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account) (e.g., `15GKOXA3H6`)
4. Ensure iOS is **enabled** and hit **save**
