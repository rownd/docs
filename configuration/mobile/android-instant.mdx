Android Instant Apps allow users to experience your app without installing it from the Play Store ‚Äî reducing friction and improving conversion. You can use this to deliver a fast, native authentication experience that gets users signed in before ever asking them to install your app.

> ‚úÖ **Best for**: High-intent flows like authentication, referral links, and onboarding.

## How it works

When users tap a link ‚Äî from a website, ad, QR code, or elsewhere ‚Äî they launch a lightweight version of your Android app instantly. No Play Store. No install step. Just instant access.

This allows you to:

- Authenticate users quickly, using Rownd
- Capture user intent with minimal drop-off
- Seamlessly transition users to the full app after sign-in

---

## Project structure

To build an Instant App, your Android project must use a **modular** structure.

### üîπ Base module (`:base`)

The base module includes shared code and resources used across your app, including your instant and installable experiences. This includes:

- Shared layouts and assets
- Common logic/utilities
- The Rownd SDK (üí°Keep it lean!)

### üîπ Feature modules

Split your app into **feature modules** for each experience:

| Module type | Purpose | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `:instant-login` | The minimal experience for Rownd login | Must stay under 15MB total size |
| `:full-app` | The installable full version of your app | Can include everything |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Play size limit**: Instant app experiences must be ‚â§15MB total (including the base module). Strip unused assets, fonts, and libraries.

---

## Getting started

### 1. Enable Instant Apps in your project

Follow [Google‚Äôs official guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant) to set up:

- Instant app support in your manifest
- `base`, `feature`, and `instant` module structure
- Instant app build variants

### 2. Add Rownd to your instant feature

Include the Rownd SDK in your `:base` module (or `:instant-login` if you want more separation). Follow the [Android SDK integration guide](/sdk-reference/mobile/android) to configure Rownd for sign-in.

#### `settings.gradle`

```groovy
include ':base', ':instant-login', ':full-app'
```

**base/build.gradle.kts**

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.rownd:android:<latest-version>")
    // other shared deps
}
```

```kotlin
class MainApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        Rownd.configure(
            this,
            "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_KEY"
        )
    }
}
```

#### `instant-login/build.gradle.kts`

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":base"))
    implementation("io.rownd:android:<latest-version>")
    // other instant app deps
}
```

```kotlin
class InstantLoginActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // Your instant app logic here
        setContent {
            InstantLoginScreen(onSignIn = {
                Rownd.requestSignIn()
            }) // Your instant app UI
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Link to your instant experience

You can generate smart links or deep links to launch your instant app directly from:
- Your website
- QR codes
- Marketing emails and campaigns

Rownd can generate these links automatically, or you can create them manually using App Links.

---

### Example use case

A referral campaign sends users a personalized link. Instead of going to the Play Store, the user:
1.	Launches your Instant App directly
2.	Authenticates via Rownd (email, passkey, social, etc.)
3.	Is optionally prompted to install the full app
4.	Their session persists into the full app after install

---

### Benefits
- Higher conversion: Fewer steps = more users signing in
- Lower bounce rate: No detour to the Play Store
- Seamless onboarding: Get users started before asking them to install
