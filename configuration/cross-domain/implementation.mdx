## Getting Started

1. **Locate your subdomain from the Rownd dashboard's** [settings](/configuration/mobile)

2. **Create or use an existing** [**app key**](/configuration/app-credentials)

3. **Form your root origin URL using the following template**
   ```
   https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.rownd.link/root/<appKey>
   ```

4. Add the root origin URL to your implementation of the Rownd SDK (see [examples](#implementation-examples) below)

5. Test to ensure everything is working. You should be able to visit one of your domains, sign in successfully, and then visit another of your domains and remain signed in.

### Implementation Examples

If you're using our WordPress, Shopify, or similar integrations, look for a "Root Origin URL" setting the the plugin or app's configuration page.

Below are some examples of how to enable cross-origin authentication across various Rownd SDKs.

#### Next.js / React / Remix

```jsx
return (
  <html lang="en">
    <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
      <RowndProvider appKey={rowndAppKey} rootOrigin={yourRootOriginUrl}>
        <AuthButtonHandler />
        {children}
      </RowndProvider>
    </body>
  </html>
);
```

#### JavaScript

For websites using the standard snippet:

```javascript
_rphConfig.push(['setRootOrigin', yourRootOriginUrl]);
```

## Best Practices

1. Maintain consistent configuration across all properties

2. Use trusted SSL certificates for all domains

3. Test authentication flow in development environment before implementing in production

4. Test user flows across different domains

## Troubleshooting

If the authentication state isn't syncing, make sure you:

1. Verify that the root origin configuration is the same across all web properties

2. Be sure SSL certificates are valid

3. Confirm the app key is correct
