#### Elements you can customize

- **Primary color**. Rownd default primary color is Purple #5B13DF. You can
  change this color to match your brand color.

- **Corner radiuses.** By default, Rownd modal and hub corners have rounded
  edges; you can choose between rounded and square corners on UI elements.

- **Overlay blurring**. By default, overlays (behind modals) blur the
  background. You can leave this on or turn it off.

- **Visual elements.** Most Rownd dialogs include "visual swoops" at the bottom
  that match the primary color you select. You can choose to remove these for
  your application.

#### How to customize

1. In the Rownd dashboard, navigate to the "Rownd Hub" tab in the left
   navigation.

2. Select the "Style and content" tab on this page.

3. Edit and change the primary color, corners, background blur, and visual
   elements with the options on the left side of the screen.

4. Preview your changes in an example UI dialog on the right side of the screen.

5. Press **Save** before leaving the page. Your updates will be applied to the
   websites and apps where you've installed the Rownd code snippet.

to reset the style to these Rownd settings.
