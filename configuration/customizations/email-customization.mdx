#### Elements you can customize

- **Email logo:** Your uploaded app logo will appear here by default, but you
  can upload an email-specific image in the email customizations area.

- **Email subject line:** The default email subject is:
  > Verify and sign in
  
  You can edit this to be more personalized to your brand or style.

  <Info>
  Remember that this email is important to ensure that your users
    successfully verify and sign in to your website or app. The email subject
    should clearly communicate the purpose of the message to encourage your
    users to open it and continue.
  </Info>

- **Email content**: The default email body is:
  > Press the button below to sign
  in and to verify this is your email address.
  
  You can edit this to be more personalized to your brand or style.

- **Button text**: Verification emails consist of a button the user must press
  to sign in and verify their email address. The default button text is:
  > Verify and sign in
  
  You can change this to be more personalized to your brand and style.

#### Email "from" address

If you prefer to have Rownd verification emails sent from an email address on your own domain (e.g., `hello@mycompany.com`), we can configure that for you. Send an email to [support@rownd.io](mailto:support@rownd.io?subject=From%20email%20address%20change) with the subject line **From email address change**. We'll process your request in about one business day and reply with further instructions to finalize the setup.
