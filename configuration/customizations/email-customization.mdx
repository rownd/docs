#### Elements you can customize

- **Email logo:** Your uploaded app logo will appear here by default, but you
  can upload an email-specific image in the email customizations area.

- **Email subject line:** The default email subject is "Verify and sign in". You
  can edit this to be more personalized to your brand or style.

  - Note: Remember that this email is important to ensure that your users
    successfully verify and sign in to your website or app. The email subject
    should clearly communicate the purpose of the message to encourage your
    users to open it and continue.

- **Email content**: The default email body is: "Press the button below to sign
  in and to verify this is your email address." You can edit this to be more
  personalized to your brand or style.

- **Button text**: Verification emails consist of a button the user must press
  to sign in and verify their email address. The default button text is "Verify
  and sign in". You can change this to be more personalized to your brand and
  style.

#### How to customize

1.  In the Rownd dashboard, navigate to the "Rownd Hub" tab in the left
    navigation.

2.  Select the "Style and content" tab on this page.

3.  Scroll down (below "Global style") to "Email and SMS content."

4.  Edit and change email settings with the options on the left side of the
    screen.

5.  Preview your changes using the example email on the right side of the
    screen.

6.  Press **Save** at the top of the page before leaving. Your updates will be
    applied to the websites and apps where you've installed your Rownd code
    snippet.

Note: Updates you've made in the
[Global style](/rownd/guides/configuration/customizations/global-style) section
will also appear here.

Once you make updates on the left side, they will reflect on the right side.

#### Email "from" address

If you prefer to have Rownd verification emails sent from an email address on
your own domain (e.g., hello@mycompany.com), we can configure that for you. Send
an email to
[support@rownd.io](mailto:support@rownd.io?subject=From%20email%20address%20change)
with the subject line "From email address change". We'll process your request in
about one business day and reply with further instructions to finalize the
setup.
