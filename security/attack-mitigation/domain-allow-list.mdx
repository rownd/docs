Domain allow-listing is a security feature in Rownd that provides an additional layer of protection for your application. By specifying a list of approved domains, you can ensure that Rownd only authenticates users from the designated websites. This helps prevent unauthorized access attempts and keeps your user data secure. By using domain allow-listing in Rownd, you can take greater control over your app's security, giving you and your users peace of mind.

## Configuring the domain allow-list
