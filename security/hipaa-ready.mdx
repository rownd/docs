# Rownd's HIPAA readiness

At Rownd, we understand the importance of compliance in the healthcare sector and are proud to announce that we are HIPAA ready. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data, and we are prepared to sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) to ensure that your data is handled in accordance with HIPAA regulations.

## What is HIPAA readiness?

HIPAA readiness means that we have implemented the necessary safeguards and protocols to protect Protected Health Information (PHI). This includes administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.

### Benefits of HIPAA readiness

- **Protected Health Information (PHI) security**: Our HIPAA readiness ensures that PHI is safeguarded with the highest security measures.
- **Regulatory compliance**: Partnering with Rownd helps you meet HIPAA requirements, reducing the risk of regulatory fines and penalties.
- **Peace of mind**: Knowing that your data is managed by a HIPAA-ready provider gives you confidence in your compliance posture.

## Moving forward

At Rownd, our commitment to security and compliance is ongoing. We continuously monitor and enhance our security practices to stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure the highest standards of data protection.
