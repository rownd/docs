With Rownd groups, you can segment your application users into logical segments. Each segment contains group members
which are tied back to application users via their `user_id`. With the group APIs, you can add a group member
directly or by creating a group invite. Group invites result in a one-time-use link that you can send to a 
user that when visited adds them to the group with specific roles. Each group member is assigned to roles, 
which are an array of strings like `"admin"` or `"editor"`. You can specify member roles via member creation 
or updates, or during an invite creation.

The groups APIs are split into two sets that differ slighly on imlementation: [Platform](#platform) and 
[User-Facing](#userfacing)

## Platform
The [platform](/api-reference/groups/platform/group-create) APIs accept Rownd application credentials for authentication. They are intended for use by an
application administrator. You should use these APIs on your backend server or equivalent to manage groups,
members, and invites

## User-Facing
The [user-facing](/api-reference/groups/user/group-create) APIs accept an authenticated user's Rownd access token (JWT) for authentication. This set of APIs is intended for use in frontend applications when you want to give your
users the ability to manage their own groups, members, and invites.

### User-Facing Distinctions
The user-facing APIs differ slightly in implementation. Here are the main differences:

#### Authorization
Group members and invites can only be managed by group owners. A group owner is a group member that has the
`"owner"` role.

#### Group Owners
The creator of a group is always given the `"owner"` role.

## Getting Started
